Here is a repository of Jupyter Notebooks for all my Machine Learning Projects. I am following the IBM Professional Certificate course, so my projects will overlap with that course.

Project 1: NFL Players and their Stats 

-- In this project, I evaluated a CSV file found on Kaggle in which NFL players and their height, weight, position, and date of birth are included. I did some data cleaning and ran an statistical test on the data.

Here is the link for the Kaggle Dataset: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/beginners-sports-analytics-nfl-dataset?select=players.csv"
