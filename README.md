Here is a repository of Jupyter Notebooks for all my Projects. I am following the IBM Professional Certificate course, so projects with **"Course #"** will overlap with that course.

## Cryptography_Projects
Here are all the projects that I did in my cryptography course at Virginia Tech. The following notebook has code blocks for each different algorithm that we learned. Algorithms are not explained in the code.

### NFL_Players_Course_1_Project 
In this project, I evaluated a CSV file found on Kaggle in which NFL players and their height, weight, position, and date of birth are included. I did some data cleaning and ran an statistical test on the data.

### Predicting_Weather
In this project, I look at a dataset found on Kaggle for the weather during WW2 to see if I can create a Linear Regression Model to predict the MAX temperature when given the MIN temperature. I first cleaned the data, then did some EDA on it to determine if we could create a model. Then, I created 3 models and determined which model was the best. I repeated this process for when given MIN temperature and precipitation to predict the MAX.

### Predicting_Soccer_Outcomes
In this project, I examine match history of the Premier League to try and find a model to predict match outcomes (win, lose, draw). First, I had to clean and prepare the data for analysis. I had to use oversampling techniques to provide a balanced results set. After this, I created LogisticRegression, KNearestNeighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extra Random Trees, Bagging, and GradientBoosting models.
